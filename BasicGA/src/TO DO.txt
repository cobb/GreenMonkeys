TODO with the prototype..

clean up output, start with tags. separate tag into string array. 
first index is genus/species, second index is tag. parse 'm' from tag and if contains, 
output in different font color

count numbers of mutated individuals in each generation. 
graphs show metrics in nice way, can use these later in the cool-looking sim!

create option to output to text file? can use the data different ways like this

create graph showing population sizes

I think we should make each section a JPanel and 
start arranging panels on the frame instead of having Visuals class extend the JPanel

how to prune the populations?
 kill some bears obviously.. but how many generations? which ones?

add a second animal

give user option to populate with chosen animal

do some fuckin writing. quit playin. play too much.
